# üìô pymkm
Python wrapper for the [cardmarket.com API](https://api.cardmarket.com/ws/documentation/API_2.0:Main_Page) (version 2.0, using OAuth1 and the "Dedicated app" option).

The included sample app can update your stock prices to trend for non-foils, and to a competitive prices for foils, all rounded to nearest .25 ‚Ç¨. A confirmation step allows you to check the result before uploading the new prices.

The app can import a .csv list of cards to your stock. It can also be used to clear your entire stock.

**NOTE:** Use this functionality at your own risk, I take no responsibility for the resulting prices. See 'price calculation' below.

The app also keeps track of how many API requests your have left each day.

## üìÑ CSV importing
If you scan cards using an app like Delver Lens or the TCG Player app, this feature can help you do bulk import of that list.

Drop your list of cards into a file called `list.csv` in the root directory (there is an example file included in this repo). The file has to follow this format (including the header row):
```
Card,Set Name,Quantity,Foil,Language
Dragon Breath,Scourge,1,Foil,French
```
Any cards that fail to import are written to a new .csv file called `failed_imports.csv`.

## üìä Competition view

This feature allows you to get a better view of how you should price individual cards depending on your local market and also the whole market:

## üî® How?
1. Install requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Copy `config_template.json` to `config.json` and fill in your API keys.
1. Run `main.py`.
1. Profit.

## üìà Price calculation
The prices for non-foils are the "trend" prices supplied by Cardmarket. I only look at English cards for now.
Cardmarket does not however supply trend prices for foils, so my algorithm is this:

_NOTE: This is a rough algorithm, designed to be safe and not to sell aggressively._

1. Filter out foils, English, not altered, not signed, minimum Good condition.
1. Set price to lowest + (median - lowest / 4), rounded to closest quarter Euro.
1. Undercut price in seller's own country by 0.25 if not contradicting 2)
1. Never go below 0.25 for foils
